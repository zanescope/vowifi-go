# vowifi-go

An independent, open Go implementation of the VoHive VoWiFi runtime boundary.

This repository focuses on the public runtime APIs and protocol layers that
VoHive consumes for SIM/ISIM AKA, SWu/ePDG tunneling, IMS registration,
messaging, voice bridging, and userspace dataplane experiments.

## Status

vowifi-go is still under active development. It is not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or a drop-in replacement for any vendor, operator, or official
closed-source VoWiFi implementation.

The project does **not** yet implement the complete feature set of the official
closed-source implementation. Full SIP transaction timer state machines,
advanced IMS feature interworking, carrier-specific behavior, production
hardening, and real-world compatibility work are still being implemented
incrementally behind the current APIs.

## Quick Start

Run the test suite:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Run the same local CI entry point used by GitHub Actions:

```sh
make ci
```

When integrating with VoHive, prefer a tagged release or pseudo-version in the
consumer `go.mod`:

```sh
go get github.com/zanescope/vowifi-go@latest
```

For local compatibility work, use `make compat-vohive`; it creates a temporary
VoHive copy and adds the local replace only inside that throwaway checkout.
