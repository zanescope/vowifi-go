# Features

This document carries the detailed implementation inventory that used to live
in the README.

## Status Note

vowifi-go is still under active development. It does not yet implement the
complete feature set of the official closed-source VoWiFi implementation, and
it should not be treated as production-ready or feature-complete.

## Runtime API Surface

This repository intentionally starts with the public API surface consumed by
VoHive:

- SIM AKA contracts under `engine/sim`
- SWu dataplane mode, tunnel establishment, and MOBIKE contracts under
  `engine/swu`
- runtime lifecycle, state, modem access, and service wrappers under
  `runtimehost`
- carrier policy and E911 request contracts under `runtimehost/carrier` and
  `runtimehost/e911`
- SMS, USSD, event dispatch, and voice gateway integration helpers under
  `runtimehost/messaging`, `runtimehost/eventhost`, and `runtimehost/voicehost`

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes the runtime boundary plus the first real
protocol layers needed by VoHive:

  reading, and USIM/ISIM AKA AUTHENTICATE primitives
- carrier presets and JSON carrier overrides, including AT&T TS.43/E911
  configuration for native `310/280` and `310/410` profiles
- TS.43-style E911 entitlement bootstrap, token/websheet handling, RAND/AUTN
  challenge response through the AKA provider, and EAP-AKA/AKA' relay packet
  response generation with Any/FullAuth/Permanent Identity selection, KDF
  negotiation, Notification ACK, and terminal Success/Failure handling, plus
  Client-Error handling for entitlement challenges

  AKA nonce extraction, Digest/AKAv1-MD5 and AKAv2-MD5 authorization material,
  IMS `Security-Client` proposal generation, `Security-Server` parsing/

  Content-Length body and duplicate-length validation, SIP response status-code
  range validation, deterministic wire ordering for REFER/supplementary-service
  headers, wire-level UDP/TCP REGISTER transport, and IMS registration binding
  parsing

  requests, with configurable T1/T2-style backoff, INVITE provisional response
  handling, non-INVITE 1xx handling that waits for final responses while
  stopping UDP retransmits after a provisional response, and response
  correlation filtering for `Call-ID`, `CSeq`, and Via branch headers when
  peers include transaction identifiers

  requests, preserving the REGISTER socket/local port for IMS NAT pinholes and
  offering explicit CRLF keepalive support, including sticky reuse of the
  selected P-CSCF after failover

  `_sip._tcp` SRV lookup, A/AAAA expansion, ordered candidate lists, and
  REGISTER/dialog transport failover before direct host:port fallback,
  including REGISTER and dialog request failover on recoverable P-CSCF final
  responses such as 503 or other transient 5xx statuses

- IMS recovery re-registration on reusable SIP flows can advance to the next
  resolved P-CSCF candidate after recoverable failures, preserving the candidate
  list instead of repeatedly selecting the same failed proxy

  runtime, returning refreshed binding, voice, SMS, and USSD transports after
  re-registration

  preserve NAT/PCSCF pinholes between SIP transactions

- runtime voice operations consume recoverable registration or route failures
  such as 481, 503, transport errors, and other transient IMS 5xx responses to
  trigger IMS re-registration, refresh voice/SMS/USSD transports, and retry an
  initial INVITE once after successful recovery, including BYE/CANCEL result
  paths that terminate local softphone dialogs
- recoverable IMS failures propagate SIP `Retry-After` delay hints from
  REGISTER refresh, voice dialogs, SMS MESSAGE, and USSD transactions so runtime
  recovery waits instead of immediately hammering a temporarily unavailable
  P-CSCF or registrar

  `sendonly`, `recvonly`, `inactive`, and legacy `c=0.0.0.0` hold handling to
  RTP forwarding while keeping RTCP feedback/report paths available, including
  disabled `m=audio 0` streams without leaking relay endpoints
- IMS Session-Expires timer negotiation across outbound and IMS-originated
  inbound initial INVITE, UPDATE, and re-INVITE paths, including
  `refresher=uac/uas` preservation, 422 Min-SE retry handling, dialog-state
  updates from 2xx responses, softphone response header propagation, and
  automatic empty UPDATE session refreshes when the negotiated refresher role
  is `uac`
- in-dialog re-INVITE handling for IMS-originated media renegotiation, including
  local client forwarding, SDP answer rewriting, Contact refresh, and ACK CSeq
  tracking for the latest successful INVITE transaction

## Known Gaps

- Complete parity with the official closed-source implementation is not
  available.
- Full SIP transaction timer state machines are still being expanded.
- Advanced IMS feature interworking and carrier-specific behavior are still
  implemented incrementally.
- Real hardware, modem, operator, and production-network compatibility require
  separate validation outside the loopback-heavy test suite.
