# Development

## Local Validation

Run the unit test suite:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Run the same local CI entry point as GitHub Actions:

```sh
make ci
```

Useful focused targets are:

- `make go-version`
- `make fmt-check`
- `make tidy-check`
- `make vet`
- `make smoke`
- `make test`
- `make race`
- `make coverage`
- `make download`
- `make compat-vohive`

The default `make ci` path stays lightweight: it checks the Go version required
by `go.mod`, downloads modules, verifies formatting and module tidiness, runs
`go vet`, compiles packages/tests with a zero-test smoke pass, then runs the
unit suite. Race and coverage runs are opt-in:

```sh
make race
make coverage
```

If Go or gofmt is installed outside `PATH`, pass them explicitly:

```sh
GO=/usr/local/go/bin/go GOFMT=/usr/local/go/bin/gofmt make ci
```

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on Ubuntu with the Go version
pinned by `go.mod`, calling `make ci` so local validation and the default CI
job share the same entry point. The workflow can also be started manually with
optional race and coverage inputs, matching `make race` and `make coverage`.

The manual `.github/workflows/vohive-compat.yml` workflow checks this module
against an older VoHive consumer checkout. It asks for the VoHive repository
and an optional ref, then runs the same compatibility script used locally.

The current test suite uses loopback networking and mock command boundaries. It
does not require a modem, root privileges, or a real TUN device in CI.

## VoHive Workspace Usage

VoHive can use this repository through its workspace:

```go
replace github.com/boa-z/vowifi-go v1.1.2 => ../vowifi-go
```

## VoHive Compatibility Check

Run the compatibility guard against a local VoHive checkout:

```sh
VOHIVE_DIR=/path/to/vohive GO=/usr/local/go/bin/go GOFMT=/usr/local/go/bin/gofmt make compat-vohive
```

The script clones or copies the VoHive checkout into a temporary directory,
rewrites legacy `vowifi-go` module references there to
`github.com/boa-z/vowifi-go` when needed, verifies no legacy module references
remain, confirms the temporary VoHive module resolves
`github.com/boa-z/vowifi-go` through a `replace` pointing at this repository,
then runs the focused VoHive test set. The source VoHive checkout is not
modified.

Useful overrides:

- `VOHIVE_COMPAT_PACKAGES` changes the tested package list.
- `VOHIVE_COMPAT_RUN` changes the `go test -run` pattern.
- `VOHIVE_COMPAT_BUILD_PACKAGES` optionally adds `go build` package checks.
- `VOHIVE_COMPAT_TMPDIR` chooses the parent directory for temporary clones and
  Go build work.
- `VOWIFI_MODULE` changes the expected current module path; leave it unset for
  the canonical `github.com/boa-z/vowifi-go` check.
- `VOWIFI_COMPAT_LEGACY_BASE` changes the legacy import owner/base rewritten
  inside the temporary VoHive copy.
